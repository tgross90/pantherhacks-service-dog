        <h1>ABOUT THE TEAM</h1>
        <p>This website was started up by participants of FIU PantherHacks 2020.
            The theme was COVID 19 and we thought this was a great solution to
            provide applicants and service dog organizations with the resources
            to function during the pandemic. The team either have a service dog
            or they're applying for one. Either way this was a cause the two of
            them are passionate about.

        <p>Marina Alonzo is an English major at FIU and currently does
            not have a service dog, however she is hoping to apply for
            one in the near future. This is one of the causes that is
            dear to her heart because she knows that dogs can do so 
            much to soothe the mind, body, and soul. She does have two
            family dogs named Oreo and Buttercup who are six. They are 
            her two favorite pups and will always be dear to her heart.
