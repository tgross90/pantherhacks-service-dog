        train service dogs so applicants can still be matched
        and they will not have to wait during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <p>Each month we will pick a new organization to donate to and we will post their biography in the box below. Since this is a prototype as of now, we don't have a charity to choose from right now. There will also be an option to donate to an individuals' service dog fundraiser depending on the organization and the individual.
