        <h1>COVID-19 Service Dog Support</h1>
        <p>Welcome! This website is for service dog handlers to have resources and find a community during the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic is not only difficult for the handlers, 
            but it's difficult for the organizations involved, and especially the service dogs. </p>

        <p>Due to COVID 19, service dog organizations and applicants are struggling. Service dogs are trained to be extremely beneficial to the emotional wellbeing of people with disabilities.

        <p>These are unprecedented times, and many service dog handlers are dealing width something they never had to before-not going out in public. The result of this is that our highly-trained service dogs, who are used to performing tasks in multiple
            settings every day, are losing some of their ability to perform the skills required to help support their handlers. This situation is not in the best interest of the dogs or the handlers. In many cases if practice isn't kept up in a skill, the ability 
            can be lost. In this case, it could also be possible. Service dog teams practice these skills every time they go out, or even in the house occasionally. With the pandemic preventing everyone from going out the service dog teams must stay in their homes.
